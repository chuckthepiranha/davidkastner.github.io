Yaku’amide A (YA) is an extremely rare peptide that was isolated from the deep-sea sponge Ceratopsion sp. Identification and characterization of this peptide unveiled its curious structural profile and its many non-standard amino acids. When tested against an array of 39 human cancer cell lines, YA exhibited notable cytotoxicity against P388 murine leukemia cells via a potentially novel mode of action. Many medically relevant peptides, such as Yaku'amide, often contain non-standard amino acids.


Our recent computational studies have identified robust parameters for the non-standard amino acids by fitting parameters to optimized quantum mechanics data computed using the Gaussian software package. However, nothing is known regarding the underlying anticancer mechanism of YA due to its extreme scarcity and arduous synthesis. It is our objective to overcome this challenge by using computational tools to identify a synthetically simpler analogue that mimics its cytotoxicity. Recently, we finished the complete parameterization of the non-standard amino acids in YA and have begun running quantum mechanics (QM)/molecular mechanic (MM) hybrid simulations using the AMBER forcefield and d95 DFT calculations. The simulations are being performed using the Gaussian 09 ONIOM method. The initial calculations are very promising and show a high degree of similarity between the analogues and YA. The results indicate that we are very close to identifying an ideal analogue of YA, which will become the focus of future anticancer assays.  Figure 1. Initial superposition of YA and the first of our newly parameterized analogues via VMD. Objective. Our long-term goal is to facilitate the transition of YA to larger interdisciplinary studies that will target its novel anticancer properties. The objective of the proposed research is to identify close analogues of the scarce natural cytotoxin YA via hybrid Molecular Dynamics/Quantum Mechanics (MD/QM) simulations. These analogues will make significantly easier to synthesize and while preserving the peptide’s potent anticancer properties. Proposed Research. Our central hypothesis is that the ideal combination of symmetric amino acids needed to create a YA analogue can be predicted using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. The rationale for the proposed research is that the symmetric residues (e.g., such as ∆Val and ∆Env) exhibit conformational tendencies similar to the non-symmetric residues and should not significantly disturb the overall structure. We plan to test our central hypothesis and thereby accomplish the objective via the following two specific aims: 1. Simulate all possible analogues of YA, substituting E and Z-∆Ile for either ∆Val or ∆Env. A total of eight analogues will be simulated alongside YA. The simulations will run for several nanoseconds and will allow the new sequences to explore their energy landscapes thoroughly. 2. Determine which analogues are most likely to imitate YA. The analogues that show the lowest RMSD over several nanoseconds of MD simulations will be most likely to behave like the original YA peptide. We have collaborations to then test our optimized analogues for biological activity. Conclusions. Aims 1 and 2 will narrow the possible analogues that would need to be synthesized from eight to only a few (i.e., 2 or 3), simplifying the project significantly. Without the simulations, the alternative would be to synthesize all possible combinations and then determine the ideal compound via rigorous biological assays. The discovery of a suitable mimic would greatly expedite the interdisciplinary study of YA and is an important step in understanding its unique anticancer properties.
