Over seventy years ago in a series of inquisitive lectures, Erwin Schrödinger posed an unusual question to the physics community. ‘What is Life?’ His visionary lectures broke the complexities of life into mechanistic systems that could be explained using modern physics. As an aspiring biophysical chemist and interdisciplinary scientist, I believe Schrödinger’s question elegantly captures the beauty and inspiration behind this multidisciplinary and dynamic field by bridging the physical and biological sciences. For this reason, I am excited to be joining the ranks of versatile scientists capable of answering difficult questions about the phenomena of life across previously isolated fields. My current research agenda focuses on using the principles of biophysical chemistry and bioengineering to probe the complexities of biological molecules through molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics simulations. This interdisciplinary approach will help bring together the research of countless dedicated scientists from a myriad of disciplines to better answer the question, ‘What is life?’

Research Interests
======
My formal education is in biophysics, and my research projects span a diversity of fields: synthetic organic chemistry, mammalian tissue models, quantum chemistry calculations, protein engineering, bioinformatics, etc. During my undergraduate I worked in the field of organic chemistry under Dr. Steven Castle. Subsequently, I joined the lab of Dr. Haribabu Arthanari at Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center working on dynamic modeling of proteins using nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (NMR) techniques. Following my time at with Dr. Arthanari, I joined the lab of Dr. Nico Tjandra where I used biophysical techiques such as photon scattering, NMR, and electron microscopy to probe peptide protein interactions. Most recently, I accepted a full-time position at the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) with Dr. Trudy Oliver studying small cell lung cancer via genetically engineered mouse models. However, my interdisciplinary and variegated background belies a consistent and immutable desire to create something new, which is why I am have accepted to join the MIT bioengineering graduate class of 2020.
