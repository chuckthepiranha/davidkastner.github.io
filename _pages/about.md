Over seventy years ago in a series of inquisitive lectures, Erwin Schrödinger posed an unusual question to the physics community. ‘What is Life?’ His visionary lectures broke the complexities of life into mechanistic systems that could be explained using modern physics. As an aspiring biophysical chemist and interdisciplinary scientist, I believe Schrödinger’s question elegantly captures the beauty and inspiration behind this multidisciplinary and dynamic field by bridging the physical and biological sciences. For this reason, I am excited to be joining the ranks of versatile scientists capable of answering difficult questions about the phenomena of life across previously isolated fields. My current research agenda focuses on using the principles of biophysical chemistry and bioengineering to probe the complexities of biological molecules through molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics simulations. This interdisciplinary approach will help bring together the research of countless dedicated scientists from a myriad of disciplines to better answer the question, ‘What is life?’
